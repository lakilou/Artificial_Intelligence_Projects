# N-Queens Problem

---

*Generalized problem of the eight queens  so that the size of the chessboard is NxN.*

---

1.Open project with some IDE (we used Intellij).

2.Build the project.

3.Run main.java.

4.When the program runs, it asks for the number of queens.

5.Wait for the solution.

if you want to experiment, you can also change from the main.java, the parameters of the execution line that calls the generic algorithm:

* populationSize (default=1000) = size of population.
* mutationProbability (default=0.05) = mutation probability
* maxSteps (default=1000) = repetitions of reproduction.

```
Chromosome solution = algorithm.run(numberOfQueens, populationSize, mutationProbability, maxSteps, minFitness);
```

*Enjoy*
